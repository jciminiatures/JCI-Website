            <p class="para">I am a passionate collector of dolls house miniatures based in the U.K.. Like many collectors, I also enjoy making some of my own furniture, furnishings and accessories. I am now excited to offer some of my creations for sale. The gallery page contains images of my work. My miniature patchwork quilts and cushions are hand stitched from fine cotton fabric using the English paper piecing technique. My baskets and chairs are woven with waxed linen thread and florists' wire and can take anything from a few hours to a few days to complete. Prices for baskets start at £40 and the price of a 1:12 chair is £85. Quilt prices vary according to the size and pattern but patchwork cushions start at £25.</p>
            <p class="para">Please email me using the contact button at the bottom of the page for any enquiries about price and availability of individual pieces, including any custom requests. I post both within and outside the U.K. with tracking and insurance but regret that I have no control over any customs charges that may be incurred. I will be attending the Kensington Dollshouse Festival in May where you can see and purchase my work in person. Please come and say hello!</p>  
            <p class="para">Please note that these are dolls house miniatures and NOT full size items. They are intended for adult collectors and are not suitable for children as they are delicate and may contain small parts that could be choke hazards.</p>
            <p class="para">I hope you enjoy looking at my work as much as I enjoy making it!</p>
