            <p class="para">Hello, my name is Jen. I am a passionate collector of dolls house miniatures based in the UK. 
                Like many collectors, I also enjoy making some of my own furniture, furnishings and accessories, and  
                I am now excited to offer some of my miniature 'wicker' creations for sale. Unless stated otherwise, my work is in 1:12 scale. 
            </p>
            <p class="para">
                My baskets and chairs are woven by hand using waxed linen thread and florists' wire and can take anything from a few hours to a few days to complete. 
                All my work is individually hand made and each piece is therefore unique. 
                Click anywhere on the gallery photos to see more examples of my past work. 
                Further images are also available on my instagram account (link at the bottom of the page).                
            </p>
            <p class="para">
                Please email me (using the contact button at the bottom of the page) for any enquiries about my work.                 
                I do always try to reply to emails so please check your spam folder if you do not see a response from me. 
                As I do not have an Authorised Representative under the new EU General Product Safety Regulations (GPSR), I regret that I am unable to send anything to the EU.
                However, I attend UK fairs (see dates below) 
                where you can see and purchase my work in person. Do come and say hello!</p>  
            <p class="para">
                Please note that my creations are dolls house miniatures and NOT full size items. 
                They are NOT toys. They are intended for adult collectors and are not suitable for children as they are delicate and may contain small parts that could be choke hazards.
            </p>
            <p class="para">I hope you enjoy looking at my work as much as I enjoy making it!</p>
