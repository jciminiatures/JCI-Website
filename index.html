            <p class="para">Hello, my name is Jen. I am a passionate collector of dolls house miniatures based in the UK. 
                Like many collectors, I also enjoy making some of my own furniture, furnishings and accessories. 
                I am now excited to offer some of my miniature wicker creations for sale.  
                My baskets and chairs are woven with waxed linen thread and florists' wire and can take anything from a few hours to a few days to complete. Unless stated otherwise, my work is in 1:12 scale. Prices for baskets start at £30 for a pet basket and the price of a chair is £95.
            </p>
            <p class="para">
                Please email me using the contact button at the bottom of the page for any enquiries about my work. 
                All my work is individually hand made and each piece is therefore unique. Please click on the gallery page to see examples of my past work. 
                At the moment (as of 8th August 2024), I regret that I am unable to accept any more orders due to travel and family commitments over the next few months. 
                However, I do always try to reply to emails so please check your spam folder if you do not see a response from me. I attend UK fairs (see dates below) 
                where you can see and purchase my work in person. Please come and say hello!</p>  
            <p class="para">
                Please note that these are dolls house miniatures and NOT full size items. They are intended for adult collectors and are not suitable for children as they are delicate and may contain small parts that could be choke hazards.
            </p>
            <p class="para">I hope you enjoy looking at my work as much as I enjoy making it!</p>
